###Briefing
   
Week 4 introduces the following new subject areas via the project 'Bookmark Manager'

+ Integration testing: Capybara
+ Relational databases
+ Security considerations (Email logins, passwords, and password resets) 
   
To learn these subjects we were tasked to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. A bookmark manager is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website has the following features:

+ Show a list of links from the database
+ Add new links
+ Add tags to the links
+ Filter links by a tag
    
This is the basic view of the website.
